<h2><span class="headingNumber">1. </span><span class="head">SELECTMEN'S REPORT.</span></h2>
<p>The Selectmen herewith submit the following Report of the Receipts and<br />
                    Expenditures of the town for the year 1856-7:</p>
<p>It will be seen by the Report, that, in the exhibit of repairs of highways, a<br />
                    deficiency now exists, the same arising from the payment made for breaking out<br />
                    the roads in 1856. The drifting snows of the present winter have caused an<br />
                    additional expense, which will have to be provided for by an appropriation. </p>
<p>The note of $1000, due to the Middlesex Institution for Savings, on account of<br />
                    the purchase of the Cemetery lot, was paid without any specific appropriation,<br />
                    and the Selectmen recommend that the same should be raised under an<br />
                    appropriation for general deficiencies. </p>
<p>The town voted, at the last March meeting, to purchase 300 feet of hose for<br />
                    Engine No. 1. An extra appropriation for that object will be required, which the<br />
                    Selectmen recommend. </p>
<div class="p">They recommend to the town the appropriation of the following sums for the<br />
                    ensuing year:
<ul><li class="item">For the Support of Schools, $3000</li>
<li class="item"> Principal and Interest on Town Debt, 1960</li>
<li class="item">Repairs of Highways, 1000</li>

<li class="item">General Deficiencies, 1600</li>
<li class="item">General Expenses, 1000</li>
</ul></div>
<p> A committee have been chosen to report upon the probable expense of repairs of<br />
                    the School-house in District No. 7, and a suitable appropriation should be made<br />
                    for that purpose. </p>

<p>----</p>
<p> The Library Committee present their Report for the year ending on the first<br />
                    Monday in March, 1857.</p>
<div class="p">
<ul><li class="item">The amount of money received by them has been as follows:</li>
<li class="item">The balance of last year's account, $60 00</li>
<li class="item"> The Town's appropriation for 1856, 150 00</li>
<li class="item">Fines collected by Librarian in 1856, 8 44</li>

<li class="item">Leaving a balance unexpended of 54 90</li>
<li class="item">---$218 44</li>
</ul></div>
<p> The number of volumes in the Library, as stated in our last Report, was 2074 ;<br />
                    to which have been added during the year, by purchase, 147 ; by donation, 29 ;<br />
                    making the whole number, 2,250. No book has been lost from the Library during<br />
                    the past year. </p>
<p> The number of ratable polls in Concord in the year 1856, was 569, and the<br />
                    appropriation for the maintenance and increase of the Library, which the town is<br />
                    allowed by law, and required by their contract to make this year, is<br />
                    $142.25.</p>
<p> The Librarian, Mr. Wild, has discharged the duties of his office faithfully and<br />
                    acceptably ; and his intimate acquaintance with the Library, acquired in<br />
                    arranging, numbering, and entering upon the catalogue all the books which it<br />
                    contains, makes his services more valuable than those of any other person would<br />
                    be, whom the Committee could probably engage. Considering his compensation<br />
                    inadequate, he resigned the office at the annual examination in January ; but<br />
                    the Committee assumed the responsibility of agreeing with him that if he would<br />
                    remain to this time, he should be paid at the rate of fifty dollars a year.<br />
                    Whether the town approve this arrangement, and whether they will authorize the<br />
                    Committee to continue it, is for them to determine. The Committee think it, on<br />
                    the whole, reasonable and proper. </p>
<p> The popularity and usefulness of the Library, as a means of entertainment and<br />
                    instruction to the people of the town, have suffered no diminution. It has been<br />
                    our design to add steadily to its solid and </p>
<p> 16</p>
<p>permanent value, as well as to supply, to a reasonable extent, the demand for new<br />
                    publications. Among the additions of the past year, have been Sparks' Edition of<br />
                    the Works of Franklin, in ten octavo volumes ; the twenty-five volumes, which<br />
                    make our set complete, of the British Essayists ; the new volumes of Little<br />
                    "380026" Brown's edition of the British Poets ; Motley's History of the Dutch<br />
                    Republic ; Sulley's Memoirs ; Dr. Kane's Arctic Expedition ; Lingard's History<br />
                    of England ; Hudson's Edition of Shakespeare ; Grote's History of Greece ;<br />
                    Wincklemann's History of AncientArt ; and Mr. Webster's Correspondence. A<br />
                    valuable addition to our set of American State Papers was presented by Mr. Simon<br />
                    Brown. The Committee have subscribed on behalf of the Library, for the great<br />
                    work of Prof. Agassiz on the Natural History of America, which is to be<br />
                    published in ten volumes at the price of twelve dollars a volume. The work will<br />
                    be illustrated in the highest style of art, and it is expected that one volume a<br />
                    year can be furnished until it is completed. The first volume is expected during<br />
                    the present month.</p>
<p> In conclusion, your Committee can but regret that the means at their command are<br />
                    so limited ; and would renew their annual appeal to the liberality and public<br />
                    spirit of individuals to do something to aid an institution so important to the<br />
                    community. </p>

<h2><span class="headingNumber">7. </span><span class="head">REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC GROUNDS.</span></h2>
<p>----</p>
<p>During the past season, the head stones in both the old Burying Grounds, have<br />
                    been carefully righted up, and firmly re-set erect. and cleansed of moss and<br />
                    dirt, so as to be legible. This work. which proved greater than was anticipated,<br />
                    has improved the appearance of these grounds materially, and brought to light<br />
                    some older dates than were previously known to have existed. </p>
<p>The West Centre School House lot, has been graded, and set out with evergreen and<br />
                    other trees, and a beginning made toward furnishing some shade and protection to<br />
                    this school house, which, like all the other school houses in town, has great<br />
                    need of shelter from sun and wind. The square in front of the Town House has<br />
                    been planted with large elm and other trees, carefully set out, and securely<br />
                    boxed to protect them from injury. Some objections to these trees, as<br />
                    obstructions to the travel, were raised when the work was first done, but no<br />
                    accident or inconvenience has as yet occurred, and if permitted to grow, they<br />
                    will prove a great comfort and ornament in this sandy and dusty place. </p>
<p> It should be borne in mind that a full grown tree is never in the way, and if<br />
                    there were more of them in our ways and public places, the town would be the<br />
                    handsomer and the better. </p>
<p>The hearse house has been removed from the East Burying Ground to the corner of<br />
                    the Cemetery, where it is much more convenient of access, and answers the<br />
                    purpose of a tool house, which was much wanted. The building has been painted<br />
                    and fitted up, and is in a much better condition than the hearse contained in<br />
                    it, which is too shabby for decency, and ought to be exchanged for a better one<br />
                    immediately. </p>
<div class="p">The other work including the usual care of the several public grounds,<br />
                    sufficiently appears in the following account of expenditures :
<ul><li class="item"> Paid Jonas Melvin, for work on gravestones and grounds, $38 63</li>

<li class="item">----</li>
<li class="item"> $129 88</li>
</ul></div>
<p> The balance of the appropriation will be needed to complete the new entrance to<br />
                    the hill ground, a contract for which has been made.</p>
<p> In concluding this, my eighth and last report, I may be allowed, for the first<br />
                    time, a personal word. I cannot take leave of this office, which I have held<br />
                    since its establishment by the town, without expressing my acknowledgments to my<br />
                    fellow citizens for their cordial and cheerful support in all plans for the<br />
                    improvement of their public grounds, and the unanimity of all their votes in<br />
                    relation to this subject. If, in any of the works begun or finished, I have been<br />
                    instrumental in adding to the beauty or usefulness of my native town, it has<br />
                    been compensation more than enough for all the trouble and work of the<br />
                    superintendence. In looking back to the changes that have been produced in eight<br />
                    years in the appearance of the public grounds, I am proud and grateful to have<br />
                    been permitted by the town to accomplish so much for its improvement. The iron<br />
                    fence in front of the West Burying Ground, the removal of the engine house from<br />
                    the Hill Ground, the new wall and gateway at the East Ground, the hedge at the<br />
                    Battle Ground, and the shade and ornamental trees firmly rooted and growing well<br />
                    on the Square in front of the county and town houses, are ornaments and<br />
                    improvements that I do not believe the town would give up for many times their<br />
                    cost There are further improvements that are quite as desirable, and I earnestly<br />
                    hope that the town will continue the appropriation for many years to come, and<br />
                    that, by other hands, it will be more judiciously and successfully expended. My<br />
                    other engagements and duties will prevent my giving to it the time and care that<br />
                    I should desire if I retained the office, and I have held it long enough to make<br />
                    a change perhaps advantageous and desirable, and I therefore respectfully<br />
                    decline a re-election. </p>

                    SCHOOLS, OF CONCORD, FOR THE YEAR ENDING APRIL 1, 1857.</span></h2>
<p> BENJAMIN TOLMAN, PRINTER. </p>
<p>----</p>
<p> 1857. </p>
<p>REPORT OF THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE, FOR THE YEAR ENDING APRIL 1, 1857.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The undersigned, having been previously chosen by their several districts as<br />
                    Prudential Committee, were, by a vote of the town at its last April meeting,<br />
                    elected as the School Committee of the town.</p>
<p>Their first duty, under the instruction of the town, being the choice of a<br />
                    Superintendent, they immediately met, and, after organizing by the choice of<br />
                    John Brown, Jr., as chairman, proceeded to ballot for a Superintendent. They<br />
                    made a unanimous choice of Rev. L. H. Angier for that office ; and he was<br />
                    subsequently chosen as Secretary of the board. </p>
<p>The year, we think, has been one of general improvement in the various schools,<br />
                    while harmony and good feeling have existed between the different members of the<br />
                    committee and the superintendent. </p>
<p>The Special Committee, appointed at the March meeting, to consider the whole<br />
                    subject of our schools, it is believed, will make such suggestions, and propose<br />
                    such plans, as well, if adopted, most effectually remedy the evils hitherto<br />
                    complained of, and furnish a more equal and satisfactory appointment of the<br />
                    school money among the several districts. </p>
<p>4</p>
<p> We believe that the support of our schools should be recognized as of the first<br />
                    importance, to be provided for as among the <em>necessary</em> expenses of<br />
                    the town, and subject to no accident or contingency. And we further believe,<br />
                    that, instead of the plan heretofore adopted of determining the length of the<br />
                    schools by the amount of money raised, the best policy, the truest economy, and<br />
                    the highest wisdom, alike would direct the reversing of that method, and that,<br />
                    after determining, as nearly as possible, the best and most profitable terms of<br />
                    time for the different schools to keep, we should, as a matter of course and of<br />
                    necessity, raise an amount of money sufficient to support them during that time. </p>
<p>It seems also to be desirable, that, as far as practicable, the terms of all<br />
                    schools of a similar grade should be of uniform length, and a uniform price to<br />
                    be paid to the several teachers. It is understood that these views substantially<br />
                    are adopted and carried out in the plan to be submitted by the committee<br />
                    specially appointed to report upon this subject. </p>
<p>The subject of furnishing school rooms is beginning to recieve some of the<br />
                    attention to which its importance entitles it. Instead of the blank and barren<br />
                    surface of wood and mortar usually presented in school rooms, the eye of the<br />
                    pupil should rest at every turn upon some map, diagram, or illustration of the<br />
                    various subjects embraced in education, that he may thus constantly be receiving<br />
                    impressions and lessons, silently and perhaps "unconsciously," but which may be<br />
                    as valuable and abiding as those received in the more direct methods of<br />
                    instruction. </p>
<p>5</p>
<p>In many of our schools this want is in part supplied. As we have the means and<br />
                    opportunity, let us provide all these aids and embellishments, that our school<br />
                    houses, which are all that the most cultivated taste could require, or the most<br />
                    liberal hand could grant, may be full and complete in their furnishing, as they<br />
                    are in their exterior. </p>
<p>The supply of our High School is still quite deficient in this respect. Two or<br />
                    three maps and a globe embrace the entire catalogue of its illustrative<br />
                    properties. There is a very special want of a small appropriation to supply this<br />
                    school with some philisophical apparatus. If not absolutely necessary to a<br />
                    correct understanding of the subjects which it illustrates, it is a very great<br />
                    aid to the student, and while it gives additional interest to the study, it<br />
                    makes apparent and real what might have remained vague and indefinite. We<br />
                    believe the school can no more afford to do without it than the farmer or<br />
                    mechanic can afford to do without his improved implements and tools. We<br />
                    therefore recommend that the sum of one hundred dollars be raised by the town,<br />
                    to be expended, under the direction of the General Committee, in the purchase of<br />
                    apparatus for the High School.</p>
<p> The report of the Superintendent will indicate the particular condition of the<br />
                    several schools. </p>

<p>REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT. </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>TO THE SCHOOL COMMITTEE OF CONCORD :</p>
<p>
                    <em>Gentlemen,</em> ----</p>
<p>As Superintendent of the Public Schools of Concord, an office which you did me<br />
                    the honor to confer upon me at the commencement of your official term, I<br />
                    herewith submit to you, as the statute requires, "a detailed report of the<br />
                    condition" of our schools for the year ending April 1st, 1857.</p>
<p>The importance of the trust with which you, gentlemen, have been charged by the<br />
                    town, and the responsibilities which it devolves both upon yourselves and your<br />
                    Superintendent, cannot be over-estimated. Of all the subjects which come<br />
                    regularly before the citizens of the town for consideration and action at their<br />
                    annual meeting for the transaction of town business, there is none, whose claims<br />
                    to a thorough and dispassionate deliberation and a liberal provision, are to be<br />
                    compared with those which the interests of our public schools present ;<br />
                    interests, in which the hundreds of our children, dependent upon these schools<br />
                    for their education, are deeply concerned. Would that we might catch the<br />
                    inspiration of the enthusi-</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>asm and noble purpose of the Prussian School Councillor, Dinton, who said--"I<br />
                    promised God that I would look upon every Prussian peasant child as a being who<br />
                    could complain of me before God, if I did not provide him the best education as<br />
                    a man and a christian which it was possible for me to provide."</p>
<p>There is no subject of which the Commonwealth takes cognizance and over which, in<br />
                    its legislative capacity, it exercises guardianship and control, of such vital<br />
                    interest to the welfare of the State, as that of its Common School System. The<br />
                    most voluminous and elaborate reports which are presented to the State<br />
                    Legislature during its annual session, are those of the Board of Education and<br />
                    of the Secretary of the Board--reports which should be in the hands of, and<br />
                    carefully examined by, all school committees and teachers. </p>
<p> As valuable as are our Colleges and Universities, and as important and<br />
                    indispensable as they are to the pursuits of knowledge in the higher branches of<br />
                    learning, and as powerful as is the acknowledged influence which they exert in<br />
                    maintaining and elevating the character of what are called the "learned<br />
                    professions," yet we think it no exaggeration to say that in a free government<br />
                    like ours, a government determined and maintained by the people, the common<br />
                    school system, as it is called,--a system which, in its benign provisions for<br />
                    the intellectual and moral training of the young, regards equally the child of<br />
                    the poorest as the child of the richest in the community, outranks them in<br />
                    importance. Free institutions, such as our country boasts and which do not exist<br />
                    to the same extent and in equal diffusion in any other nation </p>
<p>8</p>
<p>on the globe, demand as a condition of their stability, growth and perpetuity,<br />
                    intelligence and virtue in the people. Without the presense and constant and<br />
                    controling influence of these elements in a people who make their own laws and<br />
                    appoint their executors, we can look neither for wisdom in the legislation of<br />
                    the state, nor faithfulness and justice in the administration of its government<br />
                    and laws. And let it be remembered that our free schools, more than our Colleges<br />
                    and Universities, are the <em>sources of a nation's intelligence</em>. In<br />
                    the former, our ministers and magistrates, our lawyers and legislators, our<br />
                    jurists and presidents, commenced their education. Here, many men in our<br />
                    country, who have risen to eminent usefulness and an honorable distinction,<br />
                    received into their minds and hearts, from the hand of the teacher in the common<br />
                    school, those seeds of intelligence, wisdom and virtue, which at length ripened<br />
                    into a manhood that illustrates the history of our youthful republic, and the<br />
                    wisdom and comprehensiveness of its fathers in making the fountains of<br />
                    intelligence as free to all as the air we breathe. What interest then, we again<br />
                    ask, does the town or the state take under its supervision and guardianship<br />
                    which can compare in importance with its schools? What are commerce and<br />
                    railroads, revenues and tariffs, telegraphs, armies, and navies, and all the<br />
                    material interests of the state and nation combined, compared with the wise<br />
                    training of the intellect and heart of the people. Upon the care which this<br />
                    latter interest shall receive, more than upon any which can be bestowed upon the<br />
                    most important of our material interests, will the stability and peace, the<br />
                    growth and grandeur of this </p>
<p> 9</p>
<p>nation depend. Said Epicletus--"You will confer the greatest benefit on your<br />
                    city, not by raising the roofs, but by exalting the souls of your fellow<br />
                    citizens ; for it is better that great souls should live in small habitations<br />
                    than that abject slaves should burrow in great houses." Had the author of this<br />
                    sentiment, so just and so wise, lived in the United States in the nineteenth<br />
                    century, instead of at Rome in the second, we doubt not he would have been a<br />
                    warm friend and advocate of that system of education which seeks to embrace and<br />
                    exalt the soul of every citizen of this great Republic. </p>
<p>If these considerations, extended perhaps already to an unreasonable length, by<br />
                    way of introduction, are just, is not the condition and character of our public<br />
                    schools a matter of the highest importance? and may we not expect it will<br />
                    receive, above all other matters of common interest which will come up to be<br />
                    acted upon at the annual meeting, the most careful deliberation, the wisest<br />
                    suggestions, and the most liberal provisions of the town in its municipal<br />
                    capacity.</p>
<p>When I consider the interest which the town has hitherto taken in its schools, as<br />
                    manifested by the liberal and constantly increasing appropriations of money for<br />
                    their maintenance, I feel assured that I shall have a patient hearing while I<br />
                    proceed to give, somewhat in detail, an account of the schools for the past<br />
                    year, and make such statements and suggestions in relation to them as may be<br />
                    deemed necessary and proper to promote their best interests. </p>

<p> High School.</p>
<p>MR HENRY CHASE, <em>Teacher.</em>
                </p>
<p>The ample recommendations, upon the strength of which this gentleman was<br />
                    introduced to a former committee, and by them employed to take charge of this<br />
                    school, and the high commendations which he received in the last annual report<br />
                    of the school, after the trial of his capabilities for a single term, have been<br />
                    fully sustained by the character and results of his labors during the past year.<br />
                    From the observation which frequent visits to the school, and attendance upon<br />
                    two examinations have enabled us to make, we have the most entire conviction of<br />
                    his ability, faithfulness, and success as a teacher, and feel no hesitation in<br />
                    saying, that, in our judgement, the order and discipline of the school have<br />
                    never been more satisfactory, or the instruction more thorough. </p>
<p> From our acquaintance with this school in former years, we were satisfied that<br />
                    too many branches were undertaken at the same time, to insure that thoroughness<br />
                    of study and mastery of principles on the part of the scholars, and that<br />
                    attention from the teacher, which are so essential to thorough scholarship, and<br />
                    to the maintenance of a high standard of excellence in the school. We entirely<br />
                    concur in the views expressed by the former Superintendent in relation to this<br />
                    subject. </p>
<p> At the commencement of the year, the number of studies was somewhat reduced,<br />
                    greatly, we think, to the advantage of the school. At the commencement of the<br />
                    Winter term, French, which had been studied by a large number during the Summer<br />
                    term,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>was dropped, and Arithmetic taken up in its stead, and almost the entire school<br />
                    subjected to a thorough drilling in this important branch. The necessity of<br />
                    devoting so much time to this study would not have existed, and the progress of<br />
                    the school been retarded thereby, had those coming from the Intermediate School,<br />
                    and a few from the outer districts, been qualified agreeably to the specified<br />
                    requirements. This is a subject which demands special consideration, and<br />
                    we.shall invite your attention to it again when we come to speak of the<br />
                    condition of the Intermediate School. The High School is intended to afford the<br />
                    opportunity and means to those who wish to advance beyond the elements of a good<br />
                    English education ; to pursue such studies as the Languages, the higher<br />
                    Mathematics, the high departments of English Grammar, Chemistry, Natural and<br />
                    Mental Philosophy, "380026"c. And in order to enter it, a thorough training in<br />
                    the elementary studies should be demanded in the lower schools. Let this<br />
                    position be maintained by the town and the effect will be to elevate the<br />
                    standard not only of the High School, but of all the schools. </p>
<p>At both examinations of this school, the scholars, with some few exceptions, did<br />
                    themselves and their teacher much credit. The recitations in Algebra, Geometry<br />
                    and Greek, at the first examination were excellent. Indeed, we marked them<br />
                    perfect. We do not think the second examination equalled the first. The<br />
                    recitation in Natural Philosophy, especially, fell short of our expectations.<br />
                    During the Winter, there had been a good deal of irregularity in attendance ; a<br />
                    circumstance always unfavorable to the </p>
<p>12</p>
<p> improvement of a school. We were sorry to learn that so many were absent from<br />
                    the second examination who had been connected with the school during the Winter.<br />
                    Such absence, unless for good reasons, looks suspicious, and reflects<br />
                    unfavorably upon the absentees. An examination is seldom a terror to any but<br />
                    delinquents.</p>
<p> I cannot close my remarks upon this school without noticing the fact that,<br />
                    during a great part of the year, Mrs. Chase has heard several recitations a<br />
                    week, in which, it is believed, she has rendered an important service to the<br />
                    school, and this service has been wholly gratuitous on her part. Such an amount<br />
                    of unrecompensed labor as she has performed for the school, entitles her to the<br />
                    gratitude of the community. </p>
<p>CENTRE DISTRICT.</p>
<p>JOHN BROWN, JR., <em>Prudential Committee.</em></p>
<p>Intermediate School.</p>
<p>This school was taught, the past year, by Miss Sarah C. Buttrick, of this town.<br />
                    As Miss Buttrick entered upon her duties in this school with but a limited<br />
                    experience as a teacher, and as our own experience in our official relation to<br />
                    this school in former years had made us fully aware of the difficulties to be<br />
                    encountered in teaching it, we had great misgivings as to her success, and many<br />
                    fears that all would not be accomplished which ought to be expected from this<br />
                    school. Miss Buttrick commenced her labors in the school with a good deal of<br />
                    resoluteness, determined, if she accomplished nothing else, to bring it into a<br />
                    quiet and orderly deportment. In this, we think her success was much</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>more marked than that of some of her predecessors. At both examinations, the<br />
                    order and deportment of the school were highly satisfactory ; and such we found<br />
                    to be the case, in a good degree, at our visits to it from time to time. There<br />
                    was, in this particular, a very manifest improvement, which we think must be<br />
                    attributed, in no small degree, to the firmness and great pains taken by the<br />
                    teacher, and for which she deserves special commendation. But, in respect to the<br />
                    improvement made in the different branches of study taught in this school, it<br />
                    fell considerably below the standard which ought to be maintained, and which we<br />
                    we have a right to look for in a school of this grade. This remark will apply<br />
                    more particularly to the condition of the school during the first term. There<br />
                    seemed to be a great lack of <em>thought</em>, of <em>application</em><br />
                    and of <em>mental activity</em> ; as if the Intermediate School were not a<br />
                    place for study, but a mere stepping-stone from the Primary to the High School.<br />
                    The study in which, at the first examination, we noticed the greatest<br />
                        deficiences (sic), was English Grammar. With few exceptions, the<br />
                    classes appeared to know but little about it. In Arithmetic, they were some<br />
                    better, but far from what might have been reasonably expected. </p>
<p>At the second examination, on the 20th of March, the school appeared to better<br />
                    advantage. There was a very marked improvement in Grammar, and in Arithmetic ;<br />
                    and in Reading, the first class, especially, appeared remarkably well. More, and<br />
                    special attention should be paid to Geography in this school, as but little or<br />
                    no attention is given to it in the High School. On the whole, we were much<br />
                    better</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>satisfied with the appearance of the school at the second examination that at the<br />
                    first. The exercises evinced some waking up of thought, more application and<br />
                    mental activity, and the school had made perceptible progress during the winter. </p>
<p>But a sense of duty compels your Superintendent to say, that, after years of<br />
                    experience and observation with regard to this school, he is fully persuaded<br />
                    that it has failed to attain the rank which a school of this grade ought to<br />
                    maintain. It is perfectly apparent that this school does not occupy the place in<br />
                    the public confidence which the other schools in the Centre District do ;<br />
                    whereas it ought to be second to none in character, as it is not in importance. </p>
<p> Parents, in some instances--perhaps not a few--have preferred to retain their<br />
                    children in the Primary Schools to sending them to the Intermediate, after they<br />
                    were qualified to enter the latter ; or if their children entered it, they have<br />
                    seemed disposed to rush them through with the utmost possible speed into the<br />
                    High School ; an evil which, if not checked, must have a depressing<br />
                    influence--and operate most unfavorably upon the character of the High School.<br />
                    And some have chosen to fit their children for promotion to the High School<br />
                    elsewhere. </p>
<p>The rank of the Intermediate School is that which belongs to what are called<br />
                    Grammar Schools. Now, it is expected and should be insisted upon, that, in these<br />
                    schools, a complete and thorough knowledge of what are called the elementary<br />
                    studies, should be acquired before a scholar can be promoted to the High School.<br />
                    Let it be understood that he shall do something more than "go over" these<br />
                    studies ; that </p>
<p>15</p>
<p>all who enter the Intermediate School will be required, before they can be<br />
                    promoted to the High, to have a thorough knowledge of the principles of, and be<br />
                    able to master anything in, the Common School Arithmetic ; that they have a good<br />
                    knowledge of English Grammar and Geography. Let this be laid down as a rule, and<br />
                    strictly adhered to, and it will not be long before we shall witness its<br />
                    beneficial effects, not only in the Intermediate, but also in the High School.<br />
                    The work of the Intermediate School should be done there, and not in the High<br />
                    School. </p>
<p>In order that these results may be reached, I am also persuaded that we must have<br />
                    a teacher for the Intermediate School of larger experience, higher<br />
                    qualifications, and a more thorough disciplinarian, than any we have had there<br />
                    for years. This remark is not intended to disparage any one of those teachers. A<br />
                    teacher may succeed very well in one school but not possess the requisite<br />
                    qualifications for another. And our Intermediate School demands qualifications<br />
                    of a high order. Schools of this grade in larger towns are, I believe, for the<br />
                    most part, taught by masters. But, as our school is not as large as those<br />
                    generally are, I believe a female teacher can be found of large experience, and<br />
                    qualified in all other respects to do the work which the interests of this<br />
                    school require. If such a teacher cannot be obtained at the present rate of<br />
                    wages, let the compensation be increased sufficiently to secure the services of<br />
                    the right person. </p>
<p>I have dwelt at greater length in my remarks upon this school than I shall upon<br />
                    any other, because I regard its condition as demanding more attention </p>
<p>16</p>
<p> than that of any other. I have pointed out what I consider the evil, and have<br />
                    suggested what seems to be the remedy. Let something be done to elevate the<br />
                    character of the Intermediate School. We pass to the</p>
<p>PRIMARY SCHOOLS.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>North Centre. </p>
<p>The teacher of this school, Miss Susan Heard, of Wayland, devoted herself with<br />
                    faithfulness to its interests, and her pupils, made very commendable progress in<br />
                    their studies. In the exercises of the second examination there was a marked<br />
                    improvement upon the first. In Reading, Spelling, Arithmetic, Geography and<br />
                    History, several of the classes did themselves great credit. If Miss Heard had<br />
                    united a little more firmness with her amiable disposition and manner, in<br />
                    maintaining order, we think the school would have appeared to still better<br />
                    advantage. This deficiency, however, was not apparent at the last examination.<br />
                    We were much pleased with the neat appearance of the children and of the school<br />
                    room, and were gratified also to see so many of the parents and friends of the<br />
                    children present to witness their exercises. </p>
<p> East Centre.</p>
<p> This school was taught the first term by Miss Harriet Buttrick, who had taught<br />
                    it in former years with a good degree of success. The exercises at the<br />
                    examination in November, did not show that degree of improvement which we had<br />
                    expected to witness. </p>
<p> During the Winter term, the school was under the care of Miss Eliza Hosmer. At<br />
                    our occasional visits</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> to the schools, we did not see that quiet and order which ought to be<br />
                    maintained. At the examination of the school in March the deportment of the<br />
                    children was entirely satisfactory, and the progress they had made in their<br />
                    studies highly commendable. In Spelling, Arithmetic and Geography, some of the<br />
                    classes appeared remarkably well. We think this school has suffered from the<br />
                    frequent changing of teachers. </p>
<p>West Centre. </p>
<p>For the last two years, this school has been under the instruction of Miss Maria<br />
                    D. Hosmer. We congratulate the children--and we congratulate the parents<br />
                    also--on their having been so long favored with the valuable services of this<br />
                    accomplished and successful teacher. It has always given us pleasure to visit<br />
                    her school. The perfect neatness of the school-room, the good order,<br />
                    sprightliness, promptness and thoroughness of the children in their recitations,<br />
                    their excellent singing, "380026"c., realize our idea of a model school more<br />
                    fully than any other of its grade with which we are acquainted. Each examination<br />
                    showed great faithfulness on the part of the teacher in her efforts for the<br />
                    intellectual and moral training of the children committed to her care, and the<br />
                    highest satisfaction was manifested with regard to the appearance of the school<br />
                    by the throng of visitors present. </p>

<p>This school was taught during the Summer term by Miss Eliza Hosmer. In most of<br />
                    the studies, the school made commendable progress during the </p>
<p>3</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>first term, and the exercises of the examination at its close, particularly in<br />
                    Arithmetic, Algebra and Geography, showed a good degree of application on the<br />
                    part of the scholars, and accuracy on the part of their teacher. </p>
<p>Miss Carrie H. Pratt, of this town, who taught the school the Winter term,<br />
                    entered upon her duties with the determination, apparently, to do her best for<br />
                    its welfare. In consequence of sickness among the children, and severe weather,<br />
                    the school was suspended for a week or more, and when examined, at the close of<br />
                    the term, it did not appear to have made that improvement which we had witnessed<br />
                    on former occasions. </p>
<p>District No. 3. </p>
<p>H. K. TOZIER, <em>Prudential Committee.</em>
                </p>
<p>This school, which was taught the previous Winter by Miss Louisa B. Hunt, was<br />
                    continued under her instruction till the close of the Summer term. At the<br />
                    examination in November, the scholars, for the most part, showed that they had<br />
                    applied themselves with commendable diligence to their studies, and that they<br />
                    had been thoroughly taught. The school was not as quiet and orderly as it should<br />
                    be. This was a noticeable deficiency. A little more energy and firmness would<br />
                    add to the qualifications which Miss Hunt already possesses for a good teacher. </p>
<p>The school during the Winter term was taught by Miss M. E. Parmenter of<br />
                    Marlborough, who labored faithfully, and with much success, for its welfare.<br />
                    There was a marked improvement in the quiet and good order of the school. The<br />
                    Winter term closed the 20th of March. We can truly say that, at no</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> previous examination of this school, which we have attended, has its appearance,<br />
                    in all respects, been more satisfactory. The exercises did the scholars great<br />
                    credit, and also their teacher, who, as I am informed, was immediately engaged<br />
                    to take the school the next term. There were too many studies pursued in the<br />
                    school for its highest improvement. </p>
<p>District No. 4. </p>
<p>SAMUEL LEES, <em>Prudential Committee.</em>
                </p>
<p>Miss Maria Wetherbee, who taught this school during the Summer term, labored with<br />
                    diligence and fidelity for the good of the school, and was quite successful. It<br />
                    was evident from the exercises of the examination, at the close of the term,<br />
                    that most of the scholars had made very good improvement. Their deportment was<br />
                    excellent. </p>
<p>The school, during the Winter term, was under the charge of Miss Charlotte A.<br />
                    Litchfield, of Southbridge. Miss Litchfield applied herself to her work with<br />
                    great diligence and zeal. She appeared to take a deep interest in the welfare of<br />
                    all her pupils. But it was not long before the unruly spirit, which, in former<br />
                    years, had disturbed the peace of the school, and added greatly to the labor of<br />
                    governing and teaching it, began to reveal itself. The teacher, though actuated<br />
                    by the kindest feelings, and exercising great forbearance, and, at first, trying<br />
                    the effect of mild measures, was determined, at all events, to be mistress of<br />
                    the school ; and when occasion called for it, she administered such punishment<br />
                    as she deemed necessary for the maintenance of good order. At length, certain<br />
                    boys, who had </p>

<p>heretofore occasioned much trouble to teachers, proving themselves incorrigible,<br />
                    were dimissed from the school--no new thing in this district. But,<br />
                    notwithstanding these troubles, and gross misrepresentations calculated to<br />
                    embarrass the teacher and injure the school, it was carried successfully through<br />
                    ; and the exercises of the examination on the 27th of March elicited high<br />
                    commendation. The performances of three classes in Arithmetic, showing accuracy<br />
                    in teaching, and a thorough knowledge and ready application of rules and<br />
                    principles, have not been surpassed by any other school in town. The deportment<br />
                    of the scholars was unexceptionable. We think the teacher labored for her school<br />
                    with conscientious fidelity and was greatly beloved by her pupils. Before the<br />
                    school closed, she had the offer of it for the ensuing term. </p>
<p>It is with deep regret that we have felt obliged to notice evils in this school<br />
                    seriously effecting its interests, of which the School Reports for several years<br />
                    past have made mention. One or two vicious or unruly boys in a school may do<br />
                    much to interfere with the success of the most accomplished instructor ; and if<br />
                    the parents and guardians of such children will no co-operate with the teacher<br />
                    in the exercise of a wholesome discipline, and such children cannot be<br />
                    restrained from damaging the interests of the school, they should be excluded<br />
                    from its privileges. </p>
<p> District No. 5,</p>
<p>JACOB B. FARMER, <em>Prudential Committee.</em>
                </p>
<p>Miss Mary H. Wood took charge of this school for the Summer term. Several of the<br />
                    classes appeared</p>
<p> 21</p>
<p>very well at the examination, and their improvement, we doubt not, would have<br />
                    been still greater had not the labors of their teacher been interrupted for<br />
                    awhile by sickness. </p>
<p> The school, during the winter term, was taught by Mr. James O. Scripture, a<br />
                    member of Dartmouth College. Mr. Scripture is a fine scholar, and appeared to<br />
                    take a deep interest in the welfare of his school. Those studying the higher<br />
                    branches, Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry, made very great improvement. Those<br />
                    in the school less advanced--and they compromised the majority--did not make as<br />
                    good progress as the others. </p>
<p>Mr. Scripture's scholars appeared to be attached to him ; and, as an additional<br />
                    evidence of the interest which he took in their welfare, it gives us pleasure to<br />
                    state that he established and maintained a weekly exercise in the evening for<br />
                    the study of the Bible. This was attended by nearly all of the members of the<br />
                    school, who appeared to take a lively interest in the exercise, and were, we<br />
                    believe, greatly profited by it. Such an evidence of a teacher's interest in the<br />
                    moral welfare of his pupils is worthy of high commendation. </p>
<p> District No. 6. </p>
<p>LEWIS WETHERBEE, <em>Prudential Committee.</em>
                </p>
<p>Mr. Wetherbee died in the autumn, and Mr. Hiram W. Jones was appointed by the<br />
                    District to fill his place. </p>
<p> The school, during the Summer term, was under the care of Miss Sarah Jane<br />
                    Wetherbee, who was faithful to her trust and did well for the School, </p>
<p> 22</p>
<p>as was evident from the exercises of the examination at its close in September.<br />
                    The school made great improvement, considering the time it kept, which was not<br />
                    so long by several weeks as most of the schools in town. </p>
<p>At the commencement of the Winter term, the school passed into the hands of Miss<br />
                    Charlotte Gorham, of Billerica. Miss Gorham gained the confidence and affections<br />
                    of her pupils, and under her instructions, they made good progress in their<br />
                    studies. The writing books in this school showed a greater degree of improvement<br />
                    in this branch than we noticed in any other school in town. At the close of the<br />
                    examination, the numerous visitors were entertained by several speeches, well<br />
                    delivered. Miss Gorham gave very general satisfaction. If she could add a little<br />
                    more energy to her amiable disposition and modest manner, we think it would tend<br />
                    to increase her usefulness as a teacher. </p>
<p>District No. 7. </p>
<p>NATHAN BARRETT, <em>Prudential Committee,</em>
                </p>
<p>This school, during the year, was taught by Miss Jane Hosmer, and did well under<br />
                    her care. The improvement evinced at the first examination was highly<br />
                    commendable. One class in Reading, several in Arithmetic, and one in Geography,<br />
                    appeared remarkably well. We do not think the improvement of the second term<br />
                    equalled that of the first. We congratulate the children of this District on the<br />
                    prospect of having a better school-room sometime during the year. </p>
<p> 23</p>
<p>I have thus, in compliance with the statute, made "a detailed report of the<br />
                    several Public Schools" in town. I have already occupied more space than I<br />
                    intended, and will therefore conclude with a very few "suggestions."</p>
<p> School Registers. </p>
<p> In a few of the Registers, we have detected errors and deficiences which show a<br />
                    want of strict attention and accuracy in keeping them. The Register must be<br />
                    "properly filled up and completed, and be deposited with the School Committee,<br />
                    or with such person as they may designate to receive it," before a "teacher is<br />
                    entitled to receive any payment for his or her services." </p>
<p> Books. </p>
<p>But few changes have been made in school books the past year. Greenleaf's<br />
                    National Arithmetic has been introduced into the High School; and we think it<br />
                    would be an advantage to the schools throughout the town to substitute this, or<br />
                    Greenleaf's Common School Arithmetic, in place of Adams'.</p>
<p>Female Teachers. </p>
<p>Our observations in the schools, in years past, had led us to adopt the opinion,<br />
                    that their interest, with the exception of the High School, would be best<br />
                    promoted by employing well qualified female teachers. Our experience the past<br />
                    year has tended only to confirm this opinion. </p>
<p> In the last Annual Report of the Secretary of the Board of Education, he<br />
                    remarks--"There has been a growing and well-grounded belief that the training of<br />
                    children in the primary and common district </p>
<p> 24</p>
<p> schools may be best confided to females." We think that all the outer districts<br />
                    of the town may obtain female teachers equal to the wants of their schools for<br />
                    from thirty to fifty dollars a term less than it would cost to employ a man ;<br />
                    and that the improvement of the largest number in the schools would be best<br />
                    advanced by so doing. And this leads us to remark that the</p>
<p> Character and Qualifications of Teachers</p>
<p> Are if the very first importance, and should be so regarded by all whose duty it<br />
                    is to engage them. The statute makes it obligatory upon the Prudential Committee<br />
                    "to ascertain whatever, by diligent and careful inquiry, he can respecting the<br />
                    moral character of the candidate he presents, his previous history, and his<br />
                    success as a teacher, if he has ever taught school before, and what means he has<br />
                    taken to qualify himself for teaching." The neglect of the duty here enjoined<br />
                    may sometimes place the Committee, to whom the candidate for examination is<br />
                    presented, in a very delicate and trying position. Let this hint suffice. </p>
<p> The statute expressly says--"It shall be the duty of all Preceptors and Teachers<br />
                    of Academies, and all other instructors of youth, to exert their best endeavors<br />
                    to impress on the minds of children and youth committed to their care and<br />
                    instruction, the principles of piety, justice and a sacred regard to truth, love<br />
                    to their country, humanity, and universal benevolence," "380026"c. Hence, it is<br />
                    evident that the greatest care should be exercised in selecting teachers, and<br />
                    that a great responsibility rests upon the <em>Prudential</em>, as well as<br />
                    the Superintending Committee. </p>
<p> 25</p>
<p> Thanking you, gentlemen, for your courtesy and counsel in our official<br />
                    relations, and congratulating you and the town upon the encouraging prospects of<br />
                    our schools, and devoutly recognizing the favor of a benign Providence towards<br />
                    them, I submit this report. </p>
<p> Respectfully, </p>
<p> L. H. ANGIER,</p>
<p>
                    <em>Superintendent of Public Schools</em>. </p>
