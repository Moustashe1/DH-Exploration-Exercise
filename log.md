instructions
The 'log' is a scratch pad where you jot down observations, problems, solutions, links that help you, anything really, as you work through the relevant tutorials. It is ok if you get stuck when doing the tutorials; your log is what enables me to help you overcome the challenges. Your log gives me a glimpse into your workflow and practice. Hit the pencil icon to edit this document.

It can be helpful to drag-and-drop screenshots of your work when you hit an error. On a mac, hit cmd + 4 to highlight the area of the screen you want to screenshot; on a Windows machine, you can hit the windows key + g to do the same thing. Drag and drop the screenshot into this folder. You can embed the image into this text file by following this pattern:

![](the-screenshot-filename.png)

Once you hit the 'commit' button, Github will embed the image. nb nothing saves unless you hit the commit button.

using wget
#make your observations here
When using wget, make sure that your current directory (that's C: Users/(you)/...) is in the same directory as the wget exe. This looks to be due to how using wget in comand line is calling the .exe file wget.exe and applying it to a website. Also becareful when downloading files using wget as sometimes you may be trying to download too much or the wrong thing. Control c seems to stop the download immediately, but user error is still a posibility as the download could have ended way faster than your reaction speed. 

#Things that challenged me:
There were a few websites that would just refuse to load/download. It made things impossible to progress. I could not properly use Python scripts to download every single page on the website as each page had a differing page name that didn't corespond with a ascending numerial naming scheme. Ergo I had manually downloaded the webpages.

#Name of Tutorial
Twine
#make your observations here
I had opted to try and attempt to recreate the website through using the medium of Twine. Putting the website data onto each twine passage was not extremely difficult, but time consuming, 
Things that challenged me:
Making the passages backtrack and making a drop down navigation menu proved to be too time consuming and would make the passage diagram a complete mess. 
Where I went for help:
I had seeked help from the twine tutorial posted in the tutorial from this class


#Name of Tutorial
Voyant
#make your observations here
The XML file for Voyant for [concord 1855-1856](https://digitalconcord.tamu.edu/content/concord-1855-1856) allowed for a great deal of data to be used, namely the Cirrus , Trends and context tabs which allowed for me to quickly sift through all the nessesary data that I needed.
Things that challenged me:
At first I was having a lot of issues making Voyant properly gather data. I had first tried to put the html from wget onto Voyant, but that led to a lot of html notation being added to the calculations/data pooling. Then I tried to control A and paste everything onto Voyant, however this improperly pasted a lot of the heading and caused a little bit of noise to be added to the statistics. Finally I tried using the XML and it worked perfectly.

#Name of Tutorial
Google Maps
#make your observations here
The Map in Google Earth provided a nice area of the City of Concord, allowing for one to visualize how the town looked/how big the lot was for the citizens at that time.
Things that challenged me:
The biggest issue was that the google earth format of file did not properly convey the location data to google maps, I could have manually typed in the city of concord, but that would have just given a single pin point of the modern location, not the old 1855 city size either. However, going on earth.google allowed me to input the google earth map files, and it provided a wonderful area/size of the town size in 1955.
Where I went for help:Google maps fourms provided little to no assistance, this is why I went with google earth [fourm](https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024836?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)

#Name of Tutorial
Antconc
#make your observations here
Antconc allows for me to open up the text file and search for terms such as slavery. Searching with a search term, then clicking on cluster shows further details on the search term, while plot shows the location of the found word in the txt file. Overall it is a very handy tool, but there's just a lot of overlap with Voyant.
Things that challenged me:
The XML file that I was using in Voyant was not properly working in Antconc, it took me a bit, but I now realised that Antconc only really reads text files, so I made a copy of the XML file, changed it to txt format, then applied it. Another challenge was simply in the amount of information being provided. It was extremely difficult to find any differing information that Voyant did not provide already.
